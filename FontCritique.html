			<p class='article-title'>Critique of the Fonts Used in FiveThirtyEight's Sumo Graphic</p>

			<center><img src='Sumo1.png'></center>

			<p class='article-text', id='4-par-1'>One   of   my   favorite   articles   from   2016   came   from   Data-Journalism   website,   FiveThirtyEight   and   it analyzed   the   career   of   the   greatest   sumo   wrestler   of   our   time,   Hakuho      (his   era   is   shown   in   the highlighted   bar   on   the   right   of   the   graphic),   with   respect   to   one   of   the   mostly   highly   respected sumo   wrestlers   of   all   time,   Raiden   (his   era   is   shown   in   the   highlighted   bar   on   the   left).   The author,   Benjamin   Morris,   performed   his   analysis   using   data   from   Sumo-Reference.com,   which has   detailed   data   dating   back   centuries.   In   this   graphic,   he   pulled   data   relating   to   the   wrestler's height,   weight,   and   success   in   the   ring.</p>

			<p class='article-text', id='4-par-2'>One   trait   of   most   FiveThirtyEight   graphics   that   I   love   is   their   headings.   For   the   viewer,   the   first couple   seconds   of   looking   at   most   graphs   involves   confusion.   But   their   headers,   placed   at   the top   and   in   bold,   guide   the   viewer   and   its   subtitle   relates   the   goal   of   the   graphic   or   the   main question   it   is   trying   to   answer.</p>

			<p class='article-text', id='4-par-2'>
			Along   with   the   summary   header,   FiveThirtyEight   is   very   particular   about   what   fonts   they   use   in their   graphics.   The   header   and   its   subtitle   are     <a href='https://commercialtype.com/catalog/atlas/atlas_grotesk'>Atlas   Grotesk   Bold   and   Atlas   Grotesk   Thin</a> respectively.   They   are   perfect   for   text   in   graphics   because   they   are   sans   serif   and   characterized by   "relatively   long   ascenders   but   short   descenders"(From   the   link   above).   First,   sans   serif   is   a font   without   serifs,   as   the   name   suggests.   A   serif   is   the   extending   feature,   similar   to   a   "tail",   on   a letter.   For   example,   this   is   written   in   serif.   Sans   serif   is   the   font   style   of   choice   for   web   journalism because   the   main   benefit   of   serif   fonts,   readability,   is   nullified   by   the   comparative   lack   of   detail provided   by   pixels   in   computer   screens   to   printing   presses   on   books.</p>

			<p class='article-text', id='4-par-3'>
			The   other   important   characteristics   of   Atlas   Grotesk   mentioned- supra    are   its   ascenders   and descenders,   most   simply   described   as   the   amount   of   a   lower-case   letter   than   extends   above   the mean   line   and   below   the   baseline   of   a   font   respectively.   A   useful   graphic   is   shown   below.</p>

			<center><img src='Sumo2.png'></center>

			<p class='article-text', id='4-par-4'>These   characteristics   combine   to   deliver   a   compact   block   of   text   that   is   readable   but   also   does not   interfere   with   the   spacing   of   the   actual   point   of   the   graphic,   the   graphic   itself. The   font   used   in   the   graphic   to   annotate   the   eras   and   the   dotted   line   is   called   Decima   Mono.   As opposed   to   Atlas   Grotesk,   it   has   shorter   ascenders   and   even   shorter   descenders.   In   this graphic,   Morris   only   uses   Capitalized   Decima   Mono   in   order   to   have   clean,   consistent,   and therefore   readable   text   within   his   graphic.   If   the   font   were   to   have   long   descenders   they   could interfere   with   the   graphic   by   literally   going   over   it   or   by   drawing   attention   away. Once   again,   Morris   uses   Atlas   Grotesk   Bold   for   the   "Weight"   and   "Height"   labels.   He   could   have used   Decima   Mono   for   the   reasons   above   but   then   their   colors   would   not   be   as   visible. In   typical   FiveThirtyEight   fashion,   the   axis   labels   are   slightly   transparent   so   as   not   to   draw attention   away   from   the   graphic.</p>

			<p class='article-text', id='4-par-5'>Morris   and   the   other   fantastic   writers   at   FiveThirtyEight   do   an   incredible,   but   under-appreciated job,   with   their   font   choice.   In   this   graphic,   he   manages   to   subtly   guide   the   viewer   through   without demanding   attention   away   from   the   main   subject.</p>
